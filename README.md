# Synth-Vis

## Work in Progress

## Project Vision

Synth-Vis is a web-based application designed to place the user in the role of a conductor for a synthesized orchestra. The project aims to translate fluid hand motions into music, where movement shapes and evolves the soundscape rather than just triggering notes. By design, the interface ensures there are no "incorrect" movements; instead, every gesture serves to shape/reinterpret the existing musical foundation into somethine new.

## Current Functionality

The current build focuses on core gesture recognition and fundamental sound modulation:

* **Activation**: The synthesizer is toggled on or off by pinching the left index finger and thumb together.
* **Spatial Modulation**:
* **X-Coordinate**: Maps the horizontal position of the left index finger to frequency.
* **Y-Coordinate**: Maps the vertical position of the left index finger to gain.



## Technical Roadmap

The following features are planned to expand the depth of the symphonic experience:

* **Multi-Voice Polyphony**: Expanding to allow chords.
* **Arpeggiation Engine**: Integrating rhythmic patterns that respond to gesture speed and placement.
* **Sample Integration**: Allow for some custom preset samples.
